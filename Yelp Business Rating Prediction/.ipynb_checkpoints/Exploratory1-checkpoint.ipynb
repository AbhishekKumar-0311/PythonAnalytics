    "This exercise uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's Yelp Business Rating Prediction competition.\n",
    "Description of the data:\n",
    "1. yelp.csv contains the dataset. It is stored in the repository (in the data directory), so there is no need to download anything from the Kaggle website.\n",
    "2. Each observation (row) in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.\n",
    "3. The stars column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.\n",
    "4. The text column is the text of the review.\n",
    "4. **Goal:** Predict the star rating of a review using only the review text.\n"

       "'Since I have ranted recently on poor customer service, and in the spirit of balance, here is a shining example of how easy it really is.\\n\\nLate last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized. Upon further inspection, it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower, one of the landscape crew had brushed against them. The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well. It was quite the nasty burned melted scar.\\n\\n After staring at it for several hours, I realized there was no virgin Mary, no Jesus, hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever, regardless of the angle or my squint. So deciding there was no money to made on eBay, I set out to get them repaired.\\n\\nDid some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona. I explained the situation and was told they could repair them, but I would have to bring them in. These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge.\\n\\nWhile pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on. I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests.\\n\\nShe came back on the phone, informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair. She could not promise when they would be repaired, but for that convenience alone I was on board. She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens, and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons.\\n\\nSomeone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens. He could not have been more accommodating, and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home. \\n\\nA few days later, Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home! Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with. I believe he was at the time the sales manager. \\n\\nWhen he arrived, the screens looked great, matched the color of the others, even with the sun bleaching over several years. He even offered to put them in! \\n\\nThis experience was way beyond any customer service expectations. No extra charges for any of the above and beyond the call of duty efforts. Outstanding, and quite refreshing.'"
